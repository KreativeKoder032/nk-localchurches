              "The Eucharist is 'the source and summit of the Christian life.' The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries
              and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained
              the whole spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch."

              "The Church which is the Body of Christ participates in the offering of ther Head.
              With him, she herself is offered whole and entire. She unites herself to his intercession with the Father for all men.
              In the Eucharist the sacrifice of Christ becomes also the sacrifice of the members of his Body.
              The lives of the faithful, their praise, sufferings, prayer, and work, are united with those of Christand with his total offering,
              and so acquire a new value. Christ's sacrifice present on the altar makes it possible for all generations of Christians 
              to be united with his offering." - (<em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>, Paragraph 1368)

              "'You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Spirit of our God.'
              One must appreciate the magnitude of the gift God has given us in the sacraments of Christian initiation in order to grasp the degree
              to which sin is excluded for him who has 'put on Christ.' But the apostle John also says:
              'If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.' And the Lord taught us to pray: 'Forgive us our trespasses,'
              linking our forgiveness of one another's offenses to the forgiveness of our sins that God will grant us."

              "Christ instituted the sacrament of Penance for all sinful members of his Church: above all for those who, since Baptism,
              have fallen into grave sin, and have thus lost thier baptismal grace and wounded ecclesial communion.
              It is to them that the sacrament of Penance offers and new possibility to convert and to recover the grace of justification.
              The Fathers of the Church present this sacrament as 'the second plank [of salvation] after the shipwreck which is the loss grace."

              "The Church and the world have a great need for Eucharistic worship. Jesus awaits us in this sacrament of love.
              Let us not refuse the time to go to meet him in adoration, in contemplation full of faith,
              and open to making amends for the serious offenses and crimes of the world. Let our adoration never cease."

              "'All generations will call me blessed': 'The Church's devotion to the Blessed Virgin is intrinsic to Christian worship.'
              The Church rightly honors 'the Blessed Virgin with special devotion. From the most ancient times the Blessed Virgin
              has been honored witht he title of 'Mother of God,' to whose protection the faithful fly in all thier dangers and needs.... 
              This very special devotion ... differs essentially from the adoration which is given to the incarnate Word and equally to the Father
              and the Holy Spirit, and greatly fosters this adoration.' The liturgical feasts dedicated to the Mother of God and Marian prayer,
              such as the rosary, an 'epitome of the whole Gospel,' express this devotion to the Virgin Mary."
